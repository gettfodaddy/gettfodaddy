Hello there! There is something that I need to tell you about me 👨‍💻 
 
I got acquainted with the IT world in my school days. Since then, I have been striving for self-improvement, by absorbing new information and honing my skills in C/C ++ development.

A little information about me:
	🔭 I’m currently working on improving my own skills  
	🌱 I’m currently learning C/C++, Basic algorithms & data structures   	
	💬 Ask me about basic algorithms, data structures (well, I'll try to answer)  	
	📫 How to reach me: @gettfodaddy (telegram)  
	⚡ Fun fact: When I'm passionate about what I'm doing, I start to fade into time, lmao 	

My goal is to become a truly qualified specialist in the direction I have chosen, to gain incomparable experience and knowledge that will help me climb one step higher towards my dream.
